# This folder contains UML diagrams.
There is a shell script that generates diagrams (currently class diagram and usecase diagram only).
It uses yUML cli (https://github.com/wandernauta/yuml).
If you use VS Code, there is an extension (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JaimeOlivares.yuml).
